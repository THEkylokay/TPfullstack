# TP fullstack
All fullstack TPs here

- TP1: Classes: Person, Employee, Manager, Director  
  Create a class hierarchy where Person is the base class, Employee inherits from Person, Manager inherits from Employee, and Director inherits from Manager. Implement constructors, properties, and a Display() method in each class. Test with an array of 8 people (5 employees, 2 managers, 1 director) and display them using both `for` and `foreach` loops.

- TP2: Vehicle classes  
  Create an abstract Vehicle class with private attributes (ID, model year, price), automatic ID generation, and abstract methods Start() and Accelerate(). Derive Car and Truck classes that implement these methods with custom messages. Include a ToString() method for vehicle info and a test class to instantiate and display cars and trucks.

- TP3: Building and House classes  
  Create a Building class with an address, constructors, properties, and a ToString() method. Create a House class that inherits from Building, adds a number of rooms, constructors, properties, and overrides ToString(). Test both classes in a program.
